# Pathfinder
Already completed project. C++ win32 application for finding routes through user-created grid maps.

To create a new map, run the program and click "Create new map". Add in height and width values for the map in the specified range
(default 2-50 tiles). Use the dropdown menus to add individual obstacle points or larger lines and shapes. The start and end points
can also be added via the dropdown menus. Click " Run" to run the A* algorithm on the map. Use the "File" menu to save your map.
The "Open from file" option on the start screen can be used to open a saved map. If a save file contains a route, it will be cleared
before the map is loaded.
